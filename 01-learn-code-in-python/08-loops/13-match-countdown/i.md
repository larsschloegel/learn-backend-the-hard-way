Match Countdown
We need a timer to countdown the start of PvP matches in Fantasy Quest.

Assignment
Complete the countdown_to_start function.

Write a loop that counts down from 10 to 1. At each iteration, print the number with an ellipsis:
10...
9...
8...
etc.
However, when i is 1, print "Fight!" additionally:
1...Fight!
Do not use the ellipsis (…) character. Use three periods (...) instead.
