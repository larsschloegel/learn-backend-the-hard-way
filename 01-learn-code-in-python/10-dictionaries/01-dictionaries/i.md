Dictionaries
Dictionaries in Python are used to store data values in key -> value pairs. Dictionaries are a great way to store groups of information.

# use curly braces
# add key-value pairs
car = {
  "brand": "Toyota",
  "model": "Camry",
  "year": 2019,
}

Here the car variable is assigned to a dictionary {} containing the keys brand, model and year. The keys' corresponding values are Toyota, Camry and 2019.

Assignment
Complete the get_character_record function. It takes a character's name, server, level, and rank as individual inputs, and returns a dictionary with the following string keys:

"name"
"server"
"level"
"rank"
"id"
Create and return a dictionary with the keys above.
Assign each of the four inputs to the matching key, i.e., "name": name.
Next, we can't have two characters named bloodwarrior123 on the same server!

For the fifth key, id, create a unique value as follows:
Concatenate the name and the server inputs with a # in the middle. For example, given:

name = "bloodwarrior123"
server = "server1"
Then the id field would be set to bloodwarrior123#server1.

Tips
You can return the dictionary directly without assigning it to a variable.
I recommend using an f-string to create the id field. This is a best practice.
