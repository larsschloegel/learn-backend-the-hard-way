Alchemy Ingredients
Fantasy Quest added a new Alchemy skill.

Assignment
Complete the check_ingredient_match function. It accepts two lists of strings:

recipe: The list of ingredients needed.
inventory: The list of ingredients the character has.
It should return two values:

A float representing the percentage of required ingredients the character has.
A new list of ingredients the character is missing but that are required.
Assume that the recipe list won't contain any duplicates (recipes require only one ingredient of each kind).

For example, if these were the lists:

recipe = ["Dragon Scale", "Unicorn Hair", "Phoenix Feather", "Troll Tusk"]
ingredients = ["Dragon Scale", "Phoenix Feather", "Troll Tusk"]

percentage, missing_ingredients = check_ingredient_match(recipe, ingredients)
print(percentage, missing_ingredients)
# Prints: 75.00 ["Unicorn Hair"]
