List Operations - Contains
Checking whether a value exists in a list or not is also really easy in Python: just use the in keyword to check for presence, or not in to check for absence.

fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
print("banana" in fruits)
# Prints: True

fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
print("banana" not in fruits)
# Prints: False

Assignment
Our players have requested an in-game feature that will allow them to type in a weapon name to check if it's in the list of top weapons in the realm.

Complete the is_top_weapon function. It should return True if the weapon is in the top_weapons list, otherwise it should return False.
