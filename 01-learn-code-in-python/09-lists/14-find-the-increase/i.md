Find the Increase
Assignment
Every day, character levels are recorded in a list. When someone levels up, we congratulate them! Your assignment is to compare the levels to identify which characters need to be congratulated!

Complete the loop inside check_character_levels. It already loops over all of the indexes i in old_character_levels. The old_character_levels and new_character_levels lists are the same length, which means you can use i to index into both.

For each iteration, use i with bracket notation to get the items at the same index from both lists.
Check if the level in old_character_levels is less than the level in the new_character_levels.
If so, print i. (Do not print anything if they didn't level up or somehow leveled down.)
For example, if the lists are:

old_character_levels = [2, 5, 3, 7, 5]
new_character_levels = [2, 5, 19, 7, 8]

Then your code would print these indexes:

2
4
