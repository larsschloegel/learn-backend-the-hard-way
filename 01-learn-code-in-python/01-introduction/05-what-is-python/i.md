Hundreds of thousands of students start their coding journey right here with Python.

Python doesn't have to be your first language, but I think it's the best first language for most developers. It gets out of your way so you can focus on learning fundamental programming concepts.
But just because Python is simple doesn't mean it's not useful! Python is an extremely popular language in the industry, and is well-known for:

Backend web servers
DevOps and cloud engineering
Machine learning
Scripting and automation
etc...
On the other hand, it isn't known for frontend development or graphical user interfaces. It's possible, but not common.
