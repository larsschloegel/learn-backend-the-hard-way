Variables Vary
Variables are called "variables" because they can hold any value and that value can change (it varies).

For example, this code prints 20:

```python
acceleration = 10
acceleration = 20
print(acceleration)
```

The line acceleration = 20 reassigns the value of acceleration to 20. It overwrites whatever was being held in the acceleration variable before (10 in this case).

Assignment
We need to reduce our hero's health as they take damage.

Before each print() function in the provided code, change the value of player_health to 100 less than it was before.

The final output should look like this:

```python
900
800
700
600
```
