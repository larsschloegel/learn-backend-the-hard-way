Math With Strings
When working with strings the + operator performs a "concatenation", which is a fancy word that means "joining two strings". Generally speaking, it's better to use string interpolation with f-strings over + concatenation.

```python
first_name = "Lane "
last_name = "Wagner"
full_name = first_name + last_name
print(full_name)
# prints "Lane Wagner"
```

full_name now holds the value "Lane Wagner".

Notice the extra space at the end of "Lane " in the first_name variable. That extra space is there to separate the words in the final result: "Lane Wagner".

Assignment
We have a second player in our game!

We need to tell each of our players how much health they have left.

Edit line 9 to print Player 1's health: You have 1200 health using string concatenation and the variables provided
Edit line 10 to print Player 2's health: You have 1100 health in the same way
Only print "You have x health" once for each player, nothing else.
