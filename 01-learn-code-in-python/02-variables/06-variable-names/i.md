Variable Names
Variable names must not have spaces. They're continuous strings of characters.

The creator of the Python language himself, Guido van Rossum, implores us to use snake_case for variable names. What is snake case? It's just a style for writing variable names. Here are some examples of different casing styles:

Name	Description	Code	Language(s) that recommend it
Snake Case	All words are lowercase and separated by underscores	num_new_users	Python, Ruby, Rust
Camel Case	Capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one	numNewUsers	JavaScript, Java
Pascal Case	Capitalize the first letter of each word	NumNewUsers	C#, C++
No Casing	All lowercase with no separation	numnewusers	...just don't do this
To be clear, your Python code will still work with Camel Case or Pascal Case, but can we please just have nice things? We just want some consistency in our craft.

If you won't use snake case for you, do it for me. I beg you.
