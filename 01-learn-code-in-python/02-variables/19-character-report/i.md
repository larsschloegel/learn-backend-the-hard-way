Character Report
One of our interns built a program that prints information about Fantasy Quest characters. It's almost done, but there are still a few bugs.

Assignment
Fix the bugs to get the character report working!

[ ] Run the code to see it fail.
[ ] Fix the syntax so that each variable is the data type you'd expect:
- name: String
- level: Integer
- character_class: String
- magic_resistance: Float (keep it equal to 15 but change it to a float)
- account_active: Boolean

Do not change the values themselves, only the syntax around them to change their data type.
Tips
You need to use the correct type-specific syntax for the variables. Here are some examples:

Type	Rule	Example
String	Double quotes	"Hello"
Integer	Whole number	42
Float	Use a Decimal	2.0
Boolean	True or False	True
