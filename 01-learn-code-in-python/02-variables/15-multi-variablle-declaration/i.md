Multi-Variable Declaration
We can save space when creating many new variables by declaring them on the same line:

```python
sword_name, sword_damage, sword_length = "Excalibur", 10, 200
```

Which is the same as:

```python
sword_name = "Excalibur"
sword_damage = 10
sword_length = 200
```

Any number of variables can be declared on the same line, and variables declared on the same line should be related to one another in some way so that the code remains easy to understand.

We call code that's easy to understand "clean code".

## Fragen
How many variables can be declared on the same line?
