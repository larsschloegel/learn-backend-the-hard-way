Math
Now that we know how to store and change the value of variables let's do some math! Here are examples of common mathematical operators using Python syntax.

Addition

```python
my_sum = a + b
```

Subtraction

```python
my_difference = x - y
```

Multiplication

```python
my_product = c * d
```

Division
```python
my_quotient = a / b
```

Order of Operations
Parentheses can be used to order math operations:

```python
first = 5
second = 7
third = 9
average_value = (first + second + third) / 3
print(average_value)
```

Which prints 7, the average of 5, 7, and 9.

Assignment
