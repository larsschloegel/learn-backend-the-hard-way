Basic Variable Types
Python has several basic data types.

Strings
In programming, snippets of text are called "strings". They're lists of characters strung together. We create strings by wrapping the text in single quotes or double quotes. That said, double quotes are preferred.

```python
name_with_single_quotes = 'boot.dev' # not so good
name_with_double_quotes = "boot.dev" # so good
```

Numbers
Numbers are not surrounded by quotes when they're declared.

An integer (or "int") is a number without a decimal part:

```python
x = 5 # positive integer
y = -5 # negative integer
```

A float is a number with a decimal part:

```python
x = 5.2
y = -5.2
```

Booleans
A "Boolean" (or "bool") is a type that can only have one of two values: True or False. As you may have heard, computers really only use 1's and 0's. These 1's and 0's are just True/False boolean values.

```python
is_tall = True
is_short = False
```

Assignment
Fix the bugs in the code. player_health should be an integer and player_has_magic should be a boolean.
