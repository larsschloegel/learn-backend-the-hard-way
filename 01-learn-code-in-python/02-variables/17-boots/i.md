Boots
You may have already figured this out by now, but below the lesson explanation (or in the Boots tab on mobile), there's an adorable bear-wizard named Boots.

His job is to help you when if you get stuck. Here's how:

- Boots is an AI chatbot (like ChatGPT) that has access to your lesson. When you ask him a question, he already knows:
    - The official solution
    - What you've been asked to do
    - Changes you've made to the code
- He's been trained not to give you the answer, but instead to use the Socratic method to nudge you in the right direction.
- Starting a conversation with Boots before you've completed a lesson costs a Baked Salmon (he's a hungry guy), or, if you don't have one, 50% of the XP for the lesson.
- Chatting with Boots after you've completed a lesson is free, and encouraged for deepening your understanding.

Assignment
Fantasy Quest's dialogue messages are all jumbled up. Fix it!

Run the code (don't submit the code). Notice that nothing prints to the console.
Ask Boots why nothing is printing. You'll need to pay up (just do it).
Use Boots to figure out what's wrong, then fix the code and submit it. Your code should produce the following output:

```
You there! Adventurer!
The local mine has been taken over by orcs!
We need your help taking it back. Bring back 8 of their axes as proof of your hard work.
```

Print the string variables given to you, don't just re-type all the text!
